## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SASS/SCSS

### What I learned

Doing this challenge really helped to solidify my React skills, which was the main goal of this challenge. However, I also learned a great deal about layout/styling with CSS. I used SASS/SCSS for the first time and I found it really helped me to write more logical and streamlined CSS. However, there are still some issues with my CSS and there's definitely more ways in which I can improve my methodology for writing CSS. I used CSS Grid too, which I haven't used in a while. So, it was good to get a refresher on these topics too.

### Continued development

Were I to continue development on this I would like to revisit my CSS. I would heavily refactor/ start agin. I struggled in particular with the tablet/mobile designs, so perhaps I would try again with a mobile-first workflow. 
I would consider using something like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/).

### Useful resources

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - I decided to give SASS a go for the first time, and I found the documentation really useful. It was very easy to get going with my first SCSS file and to set SASS up to watch for changes and compile as I go.
